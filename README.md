# What is this?
I don't really know either. Guess I wanted to use Netty again after some while.
So I've made a utility that fakes Minecraft Server Motds.

Finally: This is a standalone jar file that sends motd packets to a minecraft client.

If you want to start it on a specific port use `--port <Port` I know that implementation of this feature is shit.
